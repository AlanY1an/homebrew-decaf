  # SwiftUI openSettings and the two-parameter onChange(of:) both landed in
  # Sonoma, and the detection layer is built on the concurrency model that came
  # with it. The bare symbol is a MINIMUM, not an exact match — the string
  # comparison form that reads like one is deprecated.

  # Everything Decaf writes. The hook entries it can add to
  # ~/.claude/settings.json are deliberately NOT zapped: that file belongs to
  # Claude Code, and removing another tool's config from a cask would be
  # overreach. Settings -> Agents -> Uninstall Hooks is the reversible path,
  # and the README says so.
